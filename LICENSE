This To-Do List web app project was created while learning from a YouTube tutorial by Prashant Sir.  
I wrote the code based on the tutorial and added several enhancements, including:

- Time input support
- Background image and font styling
- Date formatting in dd-mm-yyyy format
- Persistent storage using localStorage

This code is provided for personal learning and educational use only.  
You may view and learn from it, but do not copy, redistribute, or claim this project as your own.
