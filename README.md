# To-Do List Web App â€“ Practice Project

This is a To-Do List web app I built while learning from a YouTube tutorial by **Prashant Sir**.

After implementing the base functionality from the tutorial, I made several improvements:

- Added time input field for tasks
- Managed date formatting in dd-mm-yyyy format
- Used `localStorage` to persist tasks across browser refresh
- Applied custom styling with background image and fonts

## ðŸ’¡ What I Practiced
- Implementing dynamic task handling using JavaScript DOM manipulation
- Creating and managing form inputs, including date and time fields
- Storing and retrieving data using `localStorage` for persistence
- Handling and formatting date/time
- CSS styling, layout, and fonts
